# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide for all the concepts introduced in the bootcamp prework. It serves as both a means of introduction to such concepts as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, as well as a way of easily noting down and reviewing lessons in the future. The webpage is open to be expanded on with future notes and ideas, allowing an easy way to keep notes while simultaneously putting into practice what was learned. It has allowed me a baseline of knowledge that will serve as a springboard for the concepts that will be introduced later in the bootcamp.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The page is broken into segments, each of which pertain to a specific language/concept introduced. Notes can be reviewed, as well as added to indefinitely. Opening the console in the DevTools for the page will also reveal a handful of JavaScript functions that run on page load, or can be run manually by calling either listTopics() or selectTopic().
